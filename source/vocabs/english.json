Before the war, Syria's government subsidised it and other essential food items as part of the country's welfare system in return, it hoped, for the support of its people. \r<br>But after losing control of vast areas that produce wheat, those subsidies were ended by the government and the price of bread has rocketed. \r<br>President Bashar al-Assad has countered this by importing wheat from Ukraine and Russia, which has kept prices relatively stable in government-held areas like Damascus.",
