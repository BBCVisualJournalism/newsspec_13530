    "section_3_paragraph": "With the Syrian economy 'shattered and fragmented' after five years of war and unemployment running at over 50% (up from 14% in 2011), just making ends meet can be a daily struggle for Syrian families. Nearly 70% (SCPR) of the population are living in 'extreme poverty' unable to secure the basic food and non-food items. Poverty levels increase dramatically in conflict zones.<br><br>Farming was once one of Syria's biggest industries but with production and distribution badly affected by the conflict many areas now have high levels of food insecurity. Food has become a weapon as different groups try to dominate the food trade - in both government and non-government areas. Food aid has often become diverted onto black markets or into government approved areas, ensuring supplies to rebel held areas are kept low. Reports of people starving to death have emerged from besieged towns like Madaya.",

    "section_4_paragraph": "Bakeries are at the heart of town and village life in the Arab world. Bread does not just mean food but is also synonymous with life itself. During the war production has suffered dramatically. Yeast factories and flour mills have shut down - leading to dramatic price rises. The state has lost control of vast areas that produce wheat, to counter this Assad imported wheat from Ukraine and Russia as well as paid over the odds for locally produced wheat to keep it from rebels (?). Before the war, subsidised bread was a practical and symbolic part of the country's welfare system. This - and other food subsidies - in the past provided some incentive for civilians to support the government. But these subsidies have come to an end - pushing up prices even in relatively stable areas like Damascus. In rebel and IS areas, groups that have also attempted to privide regular subsidised bread to citizens to win support (?).",
